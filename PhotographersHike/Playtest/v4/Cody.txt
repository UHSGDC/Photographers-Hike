notes:

fullscreen bug
explain last jump line better
charging is slow (charging speed option possibly)
vine made cody think that he can climb walls
ability to turn off jump line
spike hitbox a little unfair
jump when u spawn glitch
"interesting hike" *sighs*

what went well:

15-20 min total gameplay
rock climbing was intuitive
good amount of challenge
