Winston didn't understand interact key label
player is a little slippery (player accelerates too fast maybe)
winston thinks unable to pan message is unnecessary
winston was wondering if u could fast fall
iris lagging
winston didnt think rock climbing jump was possible
challenge path and easy path make em obvious
background is ugly
text is slow
picture taking tutorial with old man

vision circle appears before stealth platformer cutscene

instant stop by holding other direction

yeti particles a little distracting

font needs to be more readable

last jump on rock climbing collision

make directional signs to direct player after blizzard and rock climbing

Tell the player to use enter or space for dialog
make respawns smoother (let player be able to hold forward and have some more time to jump)

yeti sprite doesnt read as being a yeti

white line for max charge jump

make jump hitbox bigger at feet maybe, because it looks player is falling through platform

vision circle starts before cutscene for some reason, maybe its a web only thing

stealth platformer light went out after dying

first snowy level looks like it might go up

ani complained about yeti fist being too fast
